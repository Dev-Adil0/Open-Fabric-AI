A biological neuron is a complex and highly specialized cell that forms the basis of the nervous system in living organisms. It is responsible for transmitting and processing electrical signals, called nerve impulses or action potentials. \n\nAt its core, a neuron has a cell body, which contains the nucleus and other essential components. From the cell body, there are branch-like structures called dendrites that receive incoming signals from other neurons or sensory receptors. These signals, in the form of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters, can excite or inhibit the neuron.\n\nThe neuron also has an elongated structure called an axon, which carries the nerve impulses away from the cell body. The axon is covered by a protective layer called the myelin sheath, which helps to speed up the transmission of impulses.\n\nWhen a neuron receives a strong enough signal, it generates an electrical impulse that travels down the axon. This impulse is propagated through the neuron's membrane by the movement of ions, specifically sodium and potassium ions, through specialized channels.\n\nAt the end of the axon, the neuron forms specialized connections called synapses with other neurons. These synapses allow the neuron to communicate with other neurons by transmitting the electrical impulse in the form of chemical signals. Neurotransmitters are released into the synapse and bind to receptors on the receiving neuron, continuing the transmission of the signal.\n\nOverall, the intricate network of biological neurons enables the transmission and processing of information in the nervous system, which is essential for various functions such as sensing the environment, controlling movement, and regulating bodily functions."]}}
