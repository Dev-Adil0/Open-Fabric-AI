It is the fundamental building block of the nervous system and is responsible for transmitting and processing electrical signals, known as nerve impulses. Neurons have a cell body, dendrites that receive signals, an axon that transmits signals, and synapses that allow communication with other neurons. They play a crucial role in functions such as sensation, movement, and cognition."]}}
